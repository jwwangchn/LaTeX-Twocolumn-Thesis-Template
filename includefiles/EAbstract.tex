{\zihao{5}{\textbf{Abstract:~}In the paper, we have studied an optimal image segmentation algorithm for object extraction on the basis of superpixel algorithm. Using SLIC to generate superpixel on the UAV aerial images, afterwares, on the basis of superpixels, using spectral clustering and RAG(Region Adjacency Graph) methods to merge superpixels. According to the results, we can get the optimal image segmentation. In addition, we use BSDS500, a Berkeley image database and UAV aerial images to condact experiments over the optimal image segmentation algorithm for object extraction. According to the result, the algorithm turns out to be effecitive.\\
